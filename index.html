                                Most smartphones might already have a built-in compass, and a physical compass is just a purchase away. Why should you download Compass App by KitApp and install it on your device? First, if you do not have a built-in phone compass yet, you better download one now. It is a handy emergency tool for traveling and daily use when the unexpected happens. 
                                <br>
                                If you already have a built-in compass app on your phone, this is most likely equipped with only essential features and might need calibration from time to time for accuracy. Compass App by KitApp allows features beyond the primary compass direction and is linked to your phone coordinates without needing to calibrate from time to time. And lastly, compared to your physical compass purchase, Compass App is 100% free.

                                By now, I’m sure that you might already want to download this app. However, you might still be pondering how this app works. Compass Apps works with the use of its built-in magnetometer that is directed to the Earth's magnetic field. That means you’ll have an accurate calculation and direction to the north. So, rest assured that you can trust your directional safety while journeying remote locations.

                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>You must always refer to the red arrow since it always points to the north. If you want to know the ordinal or intercardinal directions, including the Northeast, a simple guide is to point at the middle of each cardinal direction.</p>

                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>For compass applications, your manner of calibration can affect the accuracy of the compass direction. Next would be the environmental changes, such as the surrounding devices that emit more excellent electric signals that may affect or impair your device's accuracy.</p>
