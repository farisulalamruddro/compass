You agree that you do not actually own these Virtual Items and the virtual value of any Virtual Item does not correspond or equate to any real-life monetary value, credit balance or currency.
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        Any virtual currency or similar balance does not constitute a real-world balance or comprise any stored value. Your right to use the Virtual Items is personal to you unless we agree otherwise, and is limited to the licence granted below - see section below entitled "Your right to use the Services". You may not re-sell or trade any Virtual Items.
                        <br>
